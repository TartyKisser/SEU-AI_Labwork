    "* Introduction to the CIFAR10 dataset for image classification\n",
    "* Downloading, extracing and loading an image dataset using `torchvision`\n",
    "* Show random batches of images in a grid using `torchvision.utils.make_grid`\n",
    "* Creating a convolutional neural network using with `nn.Conv2d` and `nn.MaxPool2d` layers\n",
    "* Training a convolutional neural network and visualizing the losses and errors\n",
    "* Understanding overfitting and the strategies for avoiding it (more on this later)\n",
    "* Generating predictions on single images from the test set"
